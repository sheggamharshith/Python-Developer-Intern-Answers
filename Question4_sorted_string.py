#Given a string consisting of uppercase, lowercase and numeric characters - sort the three kinds of characters separately and return the sorted string. 
# Sorting should be done such that if the jth character in the string contains a numeric value then even after sorting, 
# it should contain a numeric value only. Write a function that takes the string as input and returns the sorted string.

#Sample input - cC3bB2aA1
#Sample output- aA1bB2cC3
